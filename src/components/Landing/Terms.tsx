            or refuse any Subscriber Content for any reason or no reason, and with or
            without notice to you. Where any Subscriber Content is submitted we shall
            store such Subscriber Content in a secure and confidential manner that is
            compliant with our internal storage policies.
          </p>
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Ownership of Subscriber Content</strong>
          <p>
            Subscriber owns the Subscriber Content in any database created using the
            Platform. Title to Subscriber Content and any copies remains with
            Subscriber. Subscriber Content may be deleted by Think Crew, without
            further notice to Subscriber and without any liability to Think Crew, in
            the event that Subscriber fails to pay all amounts when due hereunder and
            fails to cure such non-payment in full within thirty (30) days of notice
            from Think Crew. In addition, Subscriber grants Think Crew the right to use
            such Subscriber Content to help diagnose problems with our servers,
            administer and improve the Think Crew Services and gather broad demographic
            information about its Subscribers and their Permitted Users. While Think
            Crew will make back-ups of Subscriber Content on a reasonable schedule,
            Think Crew is not responsible for lost or destroyed Subscriber Content,
          which loss or destruction shall be at Subscriber's sole risk.	<strong></strong>
          </p>
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Migration Services</strong>
          <p>
            Upon termination of this Agreement, and provided that Subscriber has fully
            paid all undisputed amounts due or has not otherwise materially breached
            this Agreement, Subscriber may request in writing for the prompt return of
            all Subscriber Content in a standard format offered by Think Crew. Think
            Crew may charge a reasonable sum to assist Subscriber in migrating any
            Subscriber Content. In the event that the Subscriber Content cannot be
            returned, Think Crew shall certify in writing that Think Crew has destroyed
            or otherwise deleted any electronic, archival or other copies such
            Subscriber Content from its systems and from the systems of any
            subcontractors. In the event that Think Crew must keep copies of Subscriber
            Content to fulfill legal obligations, Subscriber shall grant Think Crew the
            right to keep such Subscriber Content as required. Such migration services
            are offered at the sole discretion of Think Crew, Think Crew reserves the
          right to discontinue or modify any migration services offered at any time.	<strong></strong>
          </p>
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Monitoring Subscriber Content</strong>
          <p>
            Think Crew shall have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor all
            Subscriber Content on the Platform at all times, to determine compliance
            with this Agreement and any guidelines established by us. Without limiting
            the foregoing, Think Crew shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
            remove any Subscriber Content at its sole discretion. For example, we may
            remove Subscriber Content if we believe that any Subscriber Content may
            harm us or our business interests or violate any United States laws or
            regulations. We have no obligation to retain or provide you with copies of
            any Subscriber Content after your termination of this Agreement.
          </p>
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Subscriber Content Storage Limits and Usage Information</strong>
          <p>
            The Platform may offer reasonable storage of all Subscriber Content.
            However, all Subscriber Content storage is subject to our internal data
            storage limits. We have no obligation to store any excess Subscriber
            Content. If you violate any storage limits, Think Crew will notify you and
            may work with you to bring your usage into conformity with our data storage
            policies. If, notwithstanding our efforts, you are unable or unwilling to
            abide by our storage limits, we may invoice you for excess data storage in
            accordance with our applicable policies. Through the Platform we may
            collect your usage data and interactions with the Platform. This
            information will be used by Think Crew to determine how you use our
            Platform and how we can improve or modify our Platform. The information
            collected may be used and disseminated per our Privacy Policy
          </p>
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Platform Availability</strong>
          <p>
            Although we try to provide continuous availability to you, we do not
            guarantee that the Platform will always be available, work, or be
            accessible at any particular time. Specifically, we do not guarantee any

          <p>
            The pricing for all paid subscriptions is listed on the Think Crew website

            will have the chance to accept or reject any price increase before the paid
            subscription renewal. Please notify us if you intend to reject a price
            increase. Where you have rejected a price increase, upon the expiration of
            your paid subscription, portions of the Platform may become immediately
            unavailable. You agree that Think Crew has no obligation to offer any

            <strong>
              SOME STATES, Including New Jersey, DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR

            to exclude either now or IN THE FUTURE. WHERE A TOTAL DISCLAIMER OF
            LIABILITY IS DISALLOWED YOU AGREE THAT OUR TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU SHALL NOT
            EXCEED THE AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID IN THE PAST SIX (6) MONTHS TO USE OUR
            PLATFORM OR ONE HUNDRED USD, WHICHEVER IS GREATER.

          <p>
            This defense and indemnification obligation will survive this Agreement and
            your use of the Think Crew Platform. You also agree that you have a duty to
            defend us against such claims and we may require you to pay for an
            attorney(s) of our choice in such cases. You agree that this indemnity
            extends to requiring you to pay for our reasonable attorneys' fees, court
            costs, and disbursements. In the event of a claim such as one described in
            this paragraph, we may elect to settle with the party/parties making the

        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Choice of Law</strong>
          <p>
            This Agreement shall be governed by the laws in force in the state of
            California. The offer and acceptance of this contract is deemed to have
            occurred in the state of California.
          </p>
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Disputes</strong>
          <p>
            Any dispute relating in any way to your visit to the Platform or our
            Platform shall be submitted to confidential arbitration in Los Angeles, CA.
            Arbitration under this Agreement shall be conducted pursuant to the
            applicable Commercial Rules ("Rules") then prevailing at the American
            Arbitration Association. Arbitration shall be conducted in English by one
            (1) arbitrator as selected pursuant to the Rules; the arbitrator's award
            shall be final and binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of
            competent jurisdiction. Each party shall be responsible for their own
            arbitration fees and costs. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable
            law, no arbitration under this Agreement shall be joined to an arbitration
            involving any other party subject to this Agreement, whether through class
            action proceedings or otherwise. Where permitted by the Rules, both parties
            may make any and all appearances telephonically or electronically. You
            agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or
            cause of action arising out of, related to or connected with the use of the
            Platform or this Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such
            claim or cause of action arose or be forever banned (New Jersey Subscribers
            are exempted from the foregoing one (1) year limitation). Notwithstanding
            the foregoing, either party may seek equitable relief to protect its
            interests (including but not limited to injunctive relief), or make a claim
            for nonpayment, in a court of appropriate jurisdiction, and issues of
            intellectual property ownership or infringement may be decided only by a
            court of appropriate jurisdiction and not by arbitration. In the event that
            the law does not permit the abovementioned dispute to be resolved through
            arbitration or if this arbitration agreement is unenforceable, you agree
            that any actions and disputes shall be brought solely in a court of
            competent jurisdiction located within Los Angeles County, CA.
          </p>
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Class Action Waiver</strong>
          <p>
            You and Think Crew agree that any proceedings to resolve or litigate any
            dispute whether through a court of law or arbitration shall be solely
            conducted on an individual basis. You agree that you will not seek to have
            any dispute heard as a class action, representative action, collective
            action, or private attorney general action. This class action waiver does
            not apply to New Jersey residents.
          </p>
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Severability</strong>
          <p>
            In the event that a provision of this Agreement is found to be unlawful,
            conflicting with another provision of the Agreement, or otherwise
            unenforceable, the Agreement will remain in force as though it had been
            entered into without that unenforceable provision being included in it.
          </p>
          <p>
            If two or more provisions of this Agreement or any other agreement you may
            have with Think Crew are deemed to conflict with each other's operation,
            Think Crew shall have the sole right to elect which provision remains in
            force.
          </p>
        </li>
        
        
        <li><strong>Non-Waiver</strong>
          <p>
            We reserve all rights permitted to us under this Agreement as well as under
            the provisions of any applicable law. Our non-enforcement of any particular
            provision or provisions of this Agreement or the any applicable law should
            not be construed as our waiver of the right to enforce that same provision
            under the same or different circumstances at any time in the future.
          </p>
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Assignment and Survival</strong>
          <p>
            You may not assign your rights and/or obligations under this Agreement to
            any other party without our prior written consent. We may assign our rights
            and/or obligations under this Agreement to any other party at our
            discretion. All portions of this Agreement that would reasonably be
            believed to survive termination shall survive and remain in full force upon
            termination, including but not limited to the Limitation of Liabilities,
            Representation and Warranties, Access, Payment, Indemnification, and
            Arbitration sections.
          </p>
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Termination</strong>
